# codemute - Documentation

Welcome to [codemute][cm] documentation. Here you will find information on the
projects, their source, etc. We believe documentation is extremely important
when you write code, and this repository will be constantly updated to regulate
that.

Although writing documentation is a tough job, doing in a group helps us get
there. We request everyone to contribute in writing docs. They are fun and don't
require any coding skills. :tada:
